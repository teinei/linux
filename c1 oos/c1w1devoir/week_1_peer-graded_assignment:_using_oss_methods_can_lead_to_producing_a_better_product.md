## Why choose OSS




<hr>
> Save money on buying or leasing software 

When I need a software I will looking for open source software first. For example the video players, there is vlc player, iina, mplayer, the list goes on and on. For text editors, there is VScode, Atom, vim, emacs, gedit, geany, blueJ ... And all of them are free. 

>Lowers total cost of development

When I want to develop a new software, I will search for open source projects close to mine first, to learn from others and make a better production. Sometimes I have an idea but do not know how to start, then I look at others code, voila! I know how to implement now.

>Get help and support from the community

When I buy a software, I need to get support from the software company. The support engineer is not always there and when I have any problems there is no where to find a solution online. But with OSS, there is infinite amount of posts and discussions about the software and I can always find one for my issue.

> more eyeballs 

Having more eyeballs viewing code and more groups testing it leads to stronger and more secure code

More eyeballs examining code looking for security weaknesses before they are
discovered by bad actors

More eyeballs on code find and fix bugs faster

Very large amount of teaching resources at little or no cost

School systems don’t have to pay for expensive software, even at a discount

>old hardware
Lower hardware costs and easier to use old hardware

Speeds up time to market
