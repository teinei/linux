<h1>The LWN.net Linux Distribution List</h1>

  You have found the <b>LWN.net Linux Distributions List</b>.  LWN
  has been tracking Linux distributions since 1999.  Early versions of the
  list consisted of links on the side bars of the weekly Distribution
  page.  By 2001 the list had grown to fill both sidebars of the weekly
  page, often trailing far below any actual mid-page content.  So the list
  was moved to a flat file and released on October 11, 2001.
  <p>
  The next major release was on February 7, 2002.  Additional information
  was added to each entry, and in the process links were fixed, entries
  moved to different categories and dead distributions were removed.  Minor
  revisions have been made almost every week since then.  A table of
  contents was added on May 9, 2002.  There have been no major releases
  since then, however new distributions are added when found, dead
  distributions are removed when found, and link checking remains an
  ongoing process.
  </p><p>
  Someday this list will hopefully move to a searchable database, making it
  easier than ever to find what you are looking for.  In the meantime, we
  hope you will enjoy this celebration of Linux diversity, with over 500
  distributions; large and small, specialized and generalized, old and
  new.

<h2>Leading Distributions</h2>
  Leading distributions have usually been around for a while and are
  well-established.  They generally support several architectures and are
  translated into multiple languages.  Some come from companies that supply
  service and support contracts for their products, others are community
  projects.

Android is Linux without any GNU.  Google backs Android, which can be found
in the wild in phones, tablets and other devices.  These devices usually
contain proprietary software, and some of the available apps are
proprietary as well.  See
the <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/">Android Open Source
Project</a> for the open source parts.  Android was first announced
November 5, 2007.  Android 1.5 (Cupcake) was released April 30, 2009.
Android 4.4 (KitKat) was released October 31, 2013.  Android 5.1 (Lolipop)

  The Debian Project is one of the oldest distributions, dating back to
  1993, and is currently the largest volunteer-based distribution provider.
  Debian, the "universal operating system", has been translated into many
  languages; works on many hardware platforms; has a large repository with
  a wide variety of packages; includes experimental kernel variants for
  kfreebsd and the GNU Hurd; and has many derivatives. Debian Stable
  releases when ready, not on any fixed schedule. Stable releases are
  supported for about 3 years. The Debian LTS team extends the lifetime of
  stable releases by providing security updates for a reduced set of
  packages after the Debian security team ends official support. The Debian
  testing branch (currently 10.0 "buster") is where the next stable release
  is prepared; packages are more current than stable while (usually)
  providing a stable desktop.  The unstable branch (sid) is more bleeding
  edge, while the experimental branch contains packages that aren't yet
  ready for sid. Debian 11 will be named "bullseye" and Debian 12 will be
  named "bookworm". Debian 8.0 "jessie" was released April 25, 2015. The
  eleventh and final "jessie" point release, version 8.11, was released
  June 23, 2018.  The LTS team will continue to maintain jessie until June
  30, 2020.  Debian 9.0 "stretch" was released June 17, 2017.  The ninth
  "stretch" point release, Debian 9.9, was released April 27, 2019.

  Jeoss Linux is a compact install-everywhere Ubuntu based server oriented
  distribution. It is directly-installable even on legacy, limited
  resource, and embedded x86 platforms. The install process can be
  controlled from start to finish by the target local console, a remote
  serial console, or a remote SSH sesion.  Jeoss U 8.04, released June 18,
  2011, derives from Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. Ubuntu kernels are patched versions
  of unmodified mainline Linux kernel sources from kernel.org compiled with
  Debian build system plus Ubuntu specific configuration files. Every group
  of configuration files creates a unique combination of build-time defined
  kernel variables. These variables set kernel parameters as target
  processor, memory capabilities, I/O scheduler strategies, process
  preemption, etc. Ultimately every configuration blend defines a kernel
  "flavor" for the i386 architecture targeting a specific scenarios.

  Franki and Earlgrey Linux are proof-of-concept source-based Linux
  distributions whose configuration is controlled by a loosely-knit suite
  of scripts designed to produce utility toolchains, known as STUBS.  Based
  around the uClibc library and busybox utilities, Earlgrey Linux boots
  from floppy or CD with iso- or sys-linux and hosts enough utilities in
  4MB of RAM to replicate the ramdisk content on hard disk or run its own
  ('egp') installer to do the same; "Franki" Linux is merely the codename
  for the finished result.  The first version we know of was 0.3.16,
  released Sepember 5, 2003.  Earlgrey 0.9.5-2pre2 was released September
  29, 2008.

Bedrock Linux is a Linux distribution created with the aim of making most
of the (often seemingly mutually-exclusive) benefits of various other Linux
distributions available simultaneously and transparently.  If one would
like a rock-solid stable base (for example, from Debian or a RHEL clone)
yet still have easy access to cutting-edge packages (from, say, Arch
Linux), automate compiling packages with Gentoo's portage, and ensure that
software aimed only for the ever popular Ubuntu will run smoothly - all at
the same time, in the same distribution - Bedrock Linux will provide a
means to achieve this.  Bedrock combines the Linux kernel with the Busybox
userspace for a lightweight base system. The first alpha version was
released August 3, 2012.  Bedrock 0.7.3 Poki was released April 14, 2019.

  storage capacity, this problem can be eliminated by using a network
  filesystem such as sshfs or samba.  Clonezilla live 1.2.1-53 (stable) was

  The NSLU2-Linux project exists to discuss, develop and modify the
  firmware and hardware of the Linksys NSLU2, the Synology DS101, the
  Iomega NAS100d, the D-Link DSMG600, and other ixp4xx-based devices with
  large attached storage.  SlugOS is the collective name for a group of
  firmware distributions which are derived from a common source base (and
  therefore share common documentation as a result of that). OpenSlug uses
  the OpenEmbedded package repository, and is designed for use with an
  external disk.  UcSlugC also uses the OpenEmbedded package repository,
  but is designed to be the basis of some other application-specific
  firmware distribution, rather than a firmware distribution in its own
  right.  SlugOS/LE (formerly known as DebianSlug) uses the Debian package
  repository and is an alternative for those people who want to run Debian
  on their NSLU2.  SlugOS 5.3 beta was released March 2009.

  filesystems from the same CD image, so it is guaranteed that all nodes
  run the the same software. The CD image is created by running a single
  script, which takes advantage of the Debian Live infrastructure. If you
  need to add packages, it is very easy to create a custom version by
  adding the package names to the script and then running it.  Pelican v1.0

  the portable device itself, rather this is created on the fly during the
  boot process, which only takes around 20-30 seconds on a relatively new
  computer. It is modular in design which means extra software comes in the
  form of  'modules' which can be activated and injected into the live file
  system. It does not need to be installed and uninstalled as you may
  expect with other operating systems which takes numerous amounts of
  clicks and agreements.  Porteus joined the list with the release of

  MintPPC is a Linux distribution for 32-bit PowerPC computers.  It is
  based on Linux Mint LXDE, ported to Debian/PPC.  The idea behind MintPPC
  is to have a fast good looking lightweight desktop manager, which runs
  well on older G3 and G4 machines.  MintPPC is for desktop users who want
  a very fast system without the need to install software themselves.  It
  is easy to use and it is complete.  An advantage of this distribution for
  PowerPC users is that a few bugs, which are always present in
  Debian/Ubuntu, have been overcome.  After installing MintPPC things like
  battery status meter, laptop sleep mode and sound will work out of the
  box.  MintPPC is not affiliated with Linux Mint but it uses the same
  underlying source code.  MintPPC was first released as Linux Mint LXDE
  Debian Lenny in May 2010.  MintPPC joined the list with the release of

  Tin Hat is a Linux distribution derived from hardened Gentoo which aims
  to provide a very secure, stable and fast Desktop environment that lives
  purely in RAM. Tin Hat boots from CD, or optionally a pen drive, but it
  is not a LiveCD. It does not mount any file system from CD via unionfs or
  otherwise. Rather, Tin Hat is a massive image (approx. 2.3GB) which loads
  into tmpfs upon booting. One pays the prices of long boot times (5
  minutes off CD, 2 minutes off pen drives), but the advantage afterwords
  is that there are no delays going back to the CD when starting
  applications. Needless to say, this has some rather extreme advantages
  and disadvantages, making Tin Hat a rather particular distribution.  Tin
  Hat was added to the list with the release of 20080830.  Tin Hat 20130228
