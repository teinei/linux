# week 3 devoir

Enabling new contributors to join a project is essential to both longevity and vitality. It is the normal lifecycle that many project members eventually leave a project for various reasons, ranging from not enough time or lost interest, to disagreeing with changes in goals or governance issues or personal conflicts. New contributors bring in both more labor force, as well as fresh ideas and tools.

What are some of the methods that can be used to ease the glide path of new project members and get them to the point where they both feel comfortable with the project and can make useful contributions?

You will create and submit a short essay (2-3 paragraphs) that will expand on at least 2 methods that can be used to successfully onboard new contributors. Make sure to provide clear and concise arguments for the chosen methods.

有哪些方法可以用来缓解新项目成员的滑行路径并让他们对项目感到满意并能做出有用的贡献？
